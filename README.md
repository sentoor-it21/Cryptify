CRYPTIFY - ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT EVERYTHING
About Cryptify
Cryptify is a secure file encryption and decryption platform that leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and AES-256 to provide strong, efficient, and scalable protection for sensitive files.

Upon user registration, Cryptify generates a unique public-private key pair using ECC, ensuring secure key exchange. The platform utilizes the ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) method to derive a shared symmetric key, which is then used for file encryption and decryption through the AES-256 algorithm.

Key features of Cryptify include:
Strong encryption with AES-256 for file protection.
Secure key exchange using ECC for enhanced security with minimal computational overhead.
User-friendly interface for file encryption and decryption.
Modern cryptographic standards to safeguard sensitive data.
Cryptify is designed for anyone who values privacy and data security, making encryption both simple and highly secure.
